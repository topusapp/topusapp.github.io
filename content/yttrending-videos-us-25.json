Israel, As soon as we made the deal, they came out and they dropped a load of bombs, the likes of which I've never seen before. The biggest load that we've seen. I'm not happy with Israel. You know, when I say, okay, now you have 12 hours, you don't go out in the first hour, just drop everything you have on him. So I'm not happy with them. I'm not happy with Iran either, but I'm really unhappy if Israel is going out this morning because the one rocket that didn't land that was shot, perhaps by mistake, that didn't land, I'm not happy about that. You know what we have? We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don't know what the **** they're doing.\n\n#usa #israel #iran",

          "description": "Trump this morning: \"Yeah, I do, they violated it, but Israel violated it too. Israel, As soon as we made the deal, they came out and they dropped a load of bombs, the likes of which I've never seen before. The biggest load that we've seen. I'm not happy with Israel. You know, when I say, okay, now you have 12 hours, you don't go out in the first hour, just drop everything you have on him. So I'm not happy with them. I'm not happy with Iran either, but I'm really unhappy if Israel is going out this morning because the one rocket that didn't land that was shot, perhaps by mistake, that didn't land, I'm not happy about that. You know what we have? We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don't know what the **** they're doing.\n\n#usa #israel #iran"
