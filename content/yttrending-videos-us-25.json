        "description": "Imagine that a law abiding, completely innocent, Texas oilfield worker is just driving to a worksite and back one day as a part of his job, and his government, who is spying on him from some secret base somewhere, where a spy named Kiki is wondering why he was making the trip in one day, as opposed to two…  And so he directs a secretive unit of Texas deputies, who were trained by the highly respected legal scholar, “Dennis,” a former cop who runs Street Cop Training - since banned from training police in his home state of New Jersey - to pull over the innocent oilfield worker, and using the Jedi-mind tricks they learned from Dennis, along with an alert from a drug dog who has never NOT alerted for them, reveal the truth that the innocent oilfield worker is actually a mastermind cartel smuggling kingpin… Except that he isn’t. After detaining him for an hour and searching every inch of his truck, the deputies let the guy go. But the guy is pissed, and he complains. Internal Affairs said they did nothing wrong. So he calls the Institute for Justice. They investigate and file a lawsuit. They also tell this West Virginia lawyer with a YouTube channel, who is sort of just starting out, about the case, and he does a video on it that goes viral… Which in turn causes Internal Affairs to reopen the case and fire the deputy. And at his termination hearing, the deputy complains that the YouTube video left a lot of stuff out of the video - and that it’s just not fair… That would be crazy, wouldn’t it? Well it all happened, just like that.

And the man who killed them.\nSamuel Davidson was three times over the legal alcohol limit, drug-affected and out of control when the ute he was driving mounted a footpath and mowed down seven children in the 2020 Oatlands tragedy that shocked the nation.\n\nAbdallah siblings Antony (13), Angelina (12), and Sienna (8), along with their cousin Veronique Sakr (11), were all killed instantly. Three other children were injured.\nDavidson was sentenced on appeal to 20 years in prison, with a non-parole period of 15 years.\n\nAt the time, many Australians couldn’t comprehend how parents Danny and Leila Abdallah publicly forgave him. But now, in an extraordinary act, Danny Abdallah’s forgiveness reaches even deeper.\n\nFive years on from the tragedy, 7NEWS Spotlight has been granted rare access inside one of the country's harshest prisons to capture the raw and emotional encounter between a grieving father and the man who destroyed his world. It is an extraordinary television interview that challenges everything we think we know about restorative justice, remorse and forgiveness.\n\nFor the first time, Australians will also hear from Davidson about that horrific day, including new revelations about the reasons behind his actions and the devastating consequences that followed.\n\n*Connect with 7NEWS Spotlight online*\nVisit 🔗https://7news.com.au/spotlight\n7NEWS Spotlight Podcast 🎧 http://smarturl.it/7NewsSpotlight \nFacebook https://www.facebook.com/7newsSpotlight/\nInstagram https://instagram.com/7newsSpotlight/\nTikTok https://www.tiktok.com/@7news.spotlight\n\n7NEWS combines the trusted and powerful news brands, including Sunrise, The Morning Show and 7NEWS.com.au, delivering unique, engaging and continuous coverage on the issues that matter most to Australians.
