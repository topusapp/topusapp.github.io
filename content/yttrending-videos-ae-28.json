This way, while she’s watching the movie, all her apps still work normally, but if she tries to use the camera, the screen just shows up blurry. The phone only comes out of the case once she leaves, so no one can record the movie. Please don't forget to subscribe to my channel and like the video, thank you.",

          "description": "Note: This is for educational purposes only.\nWhen this girl goes to the theater, her phone is placed inside a special case and sealed with a pin that only staff can unlock. This way, while she’s watching the movie, all her apps still work normally, but if she tries to use the camera, the screen just shows up blurry. The phone only comes out of the case once she leaves, so no one can record the movie. Please don't forget to subscribe to my channel and like the video, thank you."

        "description": "Every time you touch your phone screen, you are holding a piece of history that almost never made it to the world. Back in the 1960s, Corning developed a super-strong glass under a secret project called “Chemcor.” It was 700 times tougher than normal glass, created through a unique chemical strengthening process. Yet, there was no commercial demand for it, so it gathered dust on the shelves for decades.\n\nFast forward to 2005, when Steve Jobs was building the first iPhone. Frustrated with plastic screens getting scratched, he demanded a tough, scratch-resistant glass. Apple turned to Corning, who revived their forgotten invention, refined it, and rebranded it as Gorilla Glass. In 2007, the iPhone launch showcased this revolutionary screen, forcing the entire smartphone industry to adopt it. Today, Gorilla Glass protects billions of devices worldwide, all thanks to a 40-year-old invention Steve Jobs refused to ignore.\n\n#gorillaglass #apple #technology #tech #invention #glass",

Maybe your phone, smart TV, or even your fridge is spying on you…\n\n⚠️ The European Union plans to bring back replaceable batteries by 2027, but is it already too late?\n\nRemember the world may watch you, but Allah ﷻ is always watching them too.\n\n#surveillance  #smartphones #foryou #facts",

          "description": "Have you ever wondered why phone companies suddenly removed replaceable batteries and forced us into built-in ones? 🤔 From 2014 onwards, almost every smartphone brand followed Apple’s lead and many believe it wasn’t just for “design” or “slimness.”\n\nEdward Snowden’s leaks revealed shocking truths: 📱\n\nYour phone can still track your location even when it’s turned OFF.\n\nThe mic and camera can be remotely activated.\n\nEven alarms work on a powered-off phone proving it’s never really off.\n\nThis video uncovers the hidden story of surveillance, 24/7 tracking, and why agencies wanted full control. Maybe your phone, smart TV, or even your fridge is spying on you…\n\n⚠️ The European Union plans to bring back replaceable batteries by 2027, but is it already too late?\n\nRemember the world may watch you, but Allah ﷻ is always watching them too.\n\n#surveillance  #smartphones #foryou #facts"
